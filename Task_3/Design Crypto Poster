## Task 3: Crypto Meme/Poster

The image is a funny Bitcoin meme showing a cool cartoon Bitcoin character wearing sunglasses, 
smiling calmly while a red price dip graph is shown in the background. It uses bright and playful colors in a cartoon style.

This meme represents the "HODL" (Hold On for Dear Life) mentality many crypto investors haveâ€”staying calm and holding their coins even when the market price drops significantly.
It makes the usual cryptocurrency market fluctuations more light-hearted and approachable for learners
